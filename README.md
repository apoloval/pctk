# Point & Click Toolkit

Welcome to the pctk repository: the toolkit to make Point&Click adventure 
games. 

This is still work in progress. Please come back later if you want to find 
something useful.

## TODO

Related to objects:

- Complete `processControlInputs`
  - `Distransitive` verbs (use X on Y, Give X to Y)
- Rendering room objects (including actors) using z-index (updating `Position` to add Z coord)
- Interact with actors
- Inventory scroll
- Allow create objects from the room definition?
